# HoaxHound
A fake news detection web application using a machine learning model.

Welcome to the Fake News Detector GitHub project! This project is a 
simple web-based application that allows you to detect fake news 
articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses 
a pre-trained machine learning model to classify news articles as 
either "Real" or "Fake" based on their content.

You can check out a live demo of the Fake News Detector <a href = "https://hoaxhound-9ddeb1255403.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Feel free to try it out with your own news articles!
